# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Project structure

```
src/
  api/           # data fetching and clients (REST/GraphQL)
  components/    # shared UI components
  features/      # feature modules (e.g., bookings, vehicles, auth)
  hooks/         # reusable hooks
  navigation/    # navigators and route helpers
  screens/       # screen containers (thin; compose features)
  services/      # non-UI logic (storage, analytics, notifications)

  theme/         # tokens, colors, spacing, typography
  utils/         # pure utilities
  assets/        # app-local assets (if not using root assets)

app/             # expo-router entry points (can import from src/*)
```

Placeholders will be created to avoid import errors until code is added.
